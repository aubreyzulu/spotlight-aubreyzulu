**Introduction**

In modern web development, monorepos are increasingly popular for managing multiple projects within a single repository. They simplify dependencies, code sharing, and overall project maintenance. Turborepo is a powerful tool designed for managing monorepos efficiently. This guide will walk you through setting up a monorepo using Turborepo to share a Prisma package between a Next.js app and a Node.js (Express) app.

**What is Turborepo?**

Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It offers several advantages for managing monorepos, including:

- **Efficient Builds**: Turborepo optimizes build times using caching and parallel execution.
  Code Sharing: Easily share code and dependencies across multiple projects within the same repository.
- **Unified Configuration**: Manage configurations in a centralized manner, reducing duplication and inconsistency.

**Why Share Prisma?**

Prisma is a modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database management. Sharing Prisma between a Next.js app and a Node.js (Express) app in a monorepo can be beneficial for several reasons:

- **Consistency:** Ensure both applications use the same database schema and configurations.
- **DRY Principle:** Avoid duplicating Prisma configurations and models, adhering to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle.
- **Centralized Updates:** Update database schema and models in one place, automatically reflecting changes across both applications.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Setup Turborepo**

First, initialize a new monorepo using Turborepo.

1. **Initialize a new Turborepo workspace:**

```bash

npx create-turbo@latest
cd my-turbo-repo
```

**Follow the prompts to set up your monorepo structure**. Ensure you have separate folders for your Next.js and Express apps, and one for shared packages.

2. **Setup Prisma Package**
   Create a new package for Prisma:

```bash

mkdir -p packages/prisma
cd packages/prisma
npm init -y

```

Install Prisma and initialize it:

```bash

npm install prisma @prisma/client
npx prisma init

```

Configure your Prisma schema in packages/prisma/prisma/schema.prisma to define your data models.

Set up a shared Prisma client:
Create a file packages/prisma/client.ts:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

export default prisma
```

3. Configure Next.js App
   Navigate to your Next.js app directory:

```bash

cd apps/nextjs-app

```

Install Prisma client:

```bash

npm install @prisma/client

```

Reference the shared Prisma client:

```typescript
// Import the shared Prisma client in your Next.js app
import prisma from 'packages/prisma/client'

// Example usage in an API route
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
  res.json(users)
}
```

4. Configure Node.js (Express) App
   Navigate to your Express app directory:

```bash

cd apps/express-app

```

Install Prisma client:

```bash

npm install @prisma/client

```

Reference the shared Prisma client:

```javascript
// Import the shared Prisma client in your Express app
const prisma = require('packages/prisma/client')

// Example usage in an endpoint
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
  res.json(users)
})
```

5. Configure Turborepo
   Modify the Turborepo configuration in turbo.json to link the Prisma package with both the Next.js and Express apps:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build", "@prisma/client"]
    }
  }
}
```

Set up your package.json workspaces:

```json
{
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
}
```

6. Run the Monorepo
   Install all dependencies:

```bash

npm install

```

Generate Prisma Client:

```bash

npx prisma generate
```

Start the development server:

```bash

npm run dev

```

With this setup, you have successfully configured a monorepo using Turborepo to share a Prisma package between a Next.js app and a Node.js (Express) app. This approach ensures consistency, adheres to the DRY principle, and simplifies centralized updates across your applications.
